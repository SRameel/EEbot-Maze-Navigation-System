EEbot Maze Navigation System  
Project Description:

Welcome to the GitHub repository of the eebot mobile robot's maze navigation system! This project showcases the robot's capability to autonomously navigate through a maze, learn its intricacies, and even reverse its path.

Features:

Guidance Line Tracking: The robot initiates its journey from the maze's entry point, diligently following a guidance line.
S-Turn Navigation: The robot's ability to navigate through S turns serves as a testament to the efficiency of the implemented guidance algorithm.
Junction Decision Making: At every junction, the robot intelligently decides which path to pursue.
Dead-End Detection & Handling: If the robot encounters a dead end (indicated by a barrier activating its front bumper), it performs a 180Â° turn, retraces its path, and opts for the alternate route. Simultaneously, it logs the correct choice for future reference.
Path Memory: The robot remembers the correct paths, ensuring efficient navigation without repetitive errors.
End-Point Detection: The maze's end is indicated by an operator's tap on the robot's rear bumper. Upon this signal, the robot retraces its steps, leveraging its memory to choose the correct paths.
Reverse Traversal: As an added spectacle, the robot can traverse the maze in reverse, offering viewers an exciting visual experience.

Implementation:

The project was executed with an emphasis on iterative testing and optimization. An initial phase involved the robot learning the maze's layout. In subsequent runs, the robot demonstrated its ability to navigate the maze flawlessly from start to finish, emphasizing its learning capability.

Conclusion:

This project underscores the eebot mobile robot's potential in maze navigation and its ability to learn and adapt to its environment. The reverse traversal feature, in particular, adds a layer of excitement and showcases the robot's versatility.
